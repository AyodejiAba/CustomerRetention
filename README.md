# CustomerRetention
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer retention patterns to identify trends, improve retention rates, and reduce churn for a business. The Customer Retention Dashboard provides key insights into customer behavior, segmentation, retention metrics, and performance over time, enabling data-driven decisions to improve customer lifetime value (CLV).

Key Features
Retention Rate Tracking: Displays customer retention and churn rates over specific periods.
Customer Segmentation: Grouping of customers based on key factors (age, location, spend, frequency, etc.).
Churn Prediction: Analyzes customer behaviors to identify potential churn risks.
Cohort Analysis: Measures retention trends of customers who joined during the same period (e.g., quarterly or monthly cohorts).
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Forecasts long-term value of retained customers.
Performance Metrics by Segment: Allows for comparison of performance (revenue, retention) across various customer segments.
